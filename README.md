# tns-winter
Datapack for the 2020 winter event on Totally Not Suspicious (TNS).

## Wiki
The wiki for this datapack is available at https://github.com/TheDeathlyCow/tns-winter/wiki. It contains a more in-depth survival guide that what you will receive in-game, though fundamentally it should contain the same information.

## Installation
This is a Minecraft Datapack for version 1.16.3-1.16.4. It is installed by placing the download of this file in .minecraft/saves/[YOUR WORLD NAME]/datapacks and then typing the command `/reload` or by re-opening the world (in single player), or restarting the server (in multiplayer). If you are in creative mode, you should see a message confirming it has been reloaded.
